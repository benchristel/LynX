apt problems

apt install needs -y
setup.sh needs -e, or it won't exit when there's an error in a step
must run apt update first
mscorefonts requires interactive eula acceptance
setup.sh halts after installing docky??
gtk3-classic has a custom install script and needs -y. it also has a bug where i
f the ppa has been installed but gtk3 has not been upgraded, the script will be
skipped.
